Overall the study abroad experience has been a good one. I know I could do a longer one if I wanted to but a month was the perfect amount of time for me. I'm proud of myself for just saying "yes" to things and immersing myself in the culture. If I could do it again I would have gotten a hotel in Paris (instead of sleeping in the photobooth at the Massy train station for 30 minutes) and taken another day/weekend trip to somewhere else in France, but I had an incredible time with an amazing group of friends. My favorite parts of the trip were the group excursions (like Paris with my friends and the castles with the school group) and the evenings when we sat on the roof of a tall building, drank wine, and listened to the live music playing below us. We had a lot of good conversations and laughed more than we didn't. We also had some kick-ass food and probably put on a few pounds but hopefully walked most of it off. I've probably second-hand smoked more in the past month than I have in my entire life but the people and chats were worth it. The open market on Saturday and Wednesday mornings had the best produce I've ever tasted and I'm going to miss the little deformed strawberries. I'm also going to miss being able to practice my french everyday and buying macaroons for less than a euro each but I'm excited for the next few weeks abroad in Germany and Spain! _Au revoir, Angers!_
