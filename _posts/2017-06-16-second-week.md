I'm officially half-way through my study abroad program! It's gone by so fast but also pretty slow- a weird feeling that accompanies a lot of good things in life. In the past two weeks, I've hit a big learning curve and visited some beautiful places. 

The homework load isn't too heavy and the credits are pass/fail so it's easier to enjoy the city instead of being stressed out. My teacher, _Elise_, is sweet and somehow always knows what I'm trying to say (which is impressive because we can only speak in French, even when we're trying to figure out how to say something we don't know yet...). She teaches my language class which I like to think of as my main class, but here's a rough breakdown:

    - Language class with Elise (2 hours every day)
    - Expression session with Baptiste, a French student at the school (2 hours most days) 
    - Culture class with various professors (1 or 2 2-hour sessions a week)
    - Project class with Baptiste and another monitor (2 hours once a week)

The schedule changes literally every day to a different variation of the classes which is nice. The classes are challenging but not overly so. We've reviewed some stuff I already knew but being in France for just a few weeks has taught me a lot about the norms and etiquette of French speaking/writing.

Last weekend we went to _Mont Saint Michel_ and _Saint Malo_. Mont Saint Michel is an old fortified abbey on an island (although it's only an island when the tide comes in?) and Saint Malo is a small city surrounded by an enormous wall you can walk all the way around on. Saint Malo is surrounded by gorgeous blue water and has a few popular beaches. There I ate the second best macaron I've ever had in a tiny shop. In Mont Saint Michel I bought a crêpe specially made for tourists and it was the worst crêpe I've ever had. Since then I've had some amazing ones though so it's okay.

The third place we went to was a chocolatier. I forget the name of the shop but I got to see how ganache was made and try the dark, milk, and white chocolate the shop uses to make their chocolates. They were all incredible. Making my own ganache-filled chocolate is definitely on my bucket list now. Also, they had a kick-ass white chocolate macaron.
